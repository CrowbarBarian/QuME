# QuME
Quake 2 bsp geometry extractor

This is the Quake 2 Map Extractor. It can be used to pull out raw geometry into an .obj file. It was designed using Code::Blocks
and WxWidgets on Linux. It is extremely alpha at this stage. It works, but it still needs more features.

Version 0.2.5 note: The code works much better now. Lots of things have been fixed. Still needs the map data and textures to be extracted from the pak files.

Dependencies: Code::Blocks v16.01, WxWidgets 3.0, and OpenGL.
Compiles and runs fine on my system, Xubuntu 16.04, no guarantees on other systems/OS's
